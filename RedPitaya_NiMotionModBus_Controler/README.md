The programs was written during my work in Functional Nonlinear Spectroscopy Lab in GTIIT, Shantou, China.

The Graphical User Interface combines 2 equipments together, RedPitaya, and NiMotion ModBus.

The RedPitaya is for data acquisition, and NiMotion ModBus is a Stepping Machine.

I developed the software of RedPitaya to realize the precise and continuous signal acquisition of pulses. And I developed the software of Stepping Machine to realize the automated movement under our control. Then I wrote the GUI to let lab members use it easier.

Unfortunately, the NiMotion ModBus is not an open source software, so I'm unable to provide its libraries, so it's unable to run the software. However, you can ask for my help if you have any questions with RedPitaya or you purchased the NiMotion ModBus. : )
